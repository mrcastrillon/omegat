My house is black.
Your house is blue.
I have a dog.
You have a cat.
I need some money.
You need some love.
You need some money too.
I need some love.
My house is black.
Your house is black.
Welcome to my house.
Please come on in!
Sit down over there.
Don't touch that!
That's my father's shotgun!
OK, you may touch it.
Don't shoot me, please!
You'll regret inviting me over.
Sorry, bye-bye.
